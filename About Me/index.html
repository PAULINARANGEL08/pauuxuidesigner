        </h5>
        <p class="card-text3"> An enthusiastic, driven, and skilled designer who believes design can impact fundamental elements of digital products as well as delivering a lasting, positive impression on the targeted audience.</p>
        <p class="card-text3"> I am from Mexico, but today you'll find me in NYC studying language and expanding my knowledge of contemporary design.</p>

<div class="frases">
<div class="frase">“I believe design has to be more than visually appealing - it has to lend itself to functional solutions.  I love to tackle new challenges and believe it's important to learn new things every day.”</div>
</div>

<div class="textaboutme">
    
<p>More than simply a visual art, I would describe Industrial Design as a plan for arranging elements to accomplish a particular purpose.  It is a field of design that demands an aesthetic eye as well as an understanding of functionality.</p>  

<p>In my work experience as a Structural Designer in Mexico, I was responsible for developing packaging that was not only aesthetically appealing, but functional, protective, and user-friendly.  Ensuring these ergonomic factors are properly addressed, while innovating on the packaging design was my strong suit, and I enjoyed the daily challenges of this role.</p>

<p>My studies as UX Designer at Columbia University NY have complemented and expanded my knowledge of this field by training me to properly research and develop an in-depth understanding the user's needs at the onset of every project. This knowledge and understanding is then used to drive every aspect of the project.</p>

<p>As  UI Designer, I have been learning how to create interactive programs that enhance a customer's experience with a brand and facilitate an enjoyable experience on the business's website.</p>

<p>My goals are to have the opportunity to expand my work experience, put in practice the coursework I have learned, acquire knowledge, as well as develop new job skills.</p>
